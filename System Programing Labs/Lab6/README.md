# Lab6
In this lab I had to create a working and efficient version of malloc, realloc and free function. I used segregated free list to do this. I had a constraint on using only simple C structures as described in the Instruction file. 

I worked only on the **mm.c** file (/Lab6/20186024_AlexandreAllani_lab6/mm.c)

Project done in KAIST (Daejeon, South Korea)
