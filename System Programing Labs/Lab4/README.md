# Lab4
In this lab I had to create a cache simulator that followed the same rules as a L1 cache. I also had to code a cache friendly version of the matrix transpose function. (comments inside the files explain how it works).

I worked only on the **csim.c** and **trans.c** files (/Lab4/20186024_AlexandreAllani_lab4/csim.c) (/Lab4/20186024_AlexandreAllani_lab4/trans.c)

Project done in KAIST (Daejeon, South Korea)
