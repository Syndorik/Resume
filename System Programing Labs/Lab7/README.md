# Lab7
In this lab I had to create a server proxy from scratch. The purpose was to deal with multiple threads. Indeed, in order to have multiple connection at the same time, multiple Threads are needed. This lead me to also use Semaphores wich is the equivalent of the word "synchronized" in Java. Finally, in the last part of this lab I coded my proxy lab so that it would efficiently cache "web" objects.

I worked only on the **proxy.c** and **cache.c** file (/Lab7/proxylab-handout/proxy.c) (/Lab7/proxylab-handout/cache.c)

Project done in KAIST (Daejeon, South Korea)
