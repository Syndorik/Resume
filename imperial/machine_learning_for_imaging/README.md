# Machine Learning For Imaging
Age regression using brain MRI scans
Volume based regression:
The purpose of this task was to first predict the volume of some areas in the brain using 3D scans MRI. A Unet architecture with residuals was used to do this. Then using a regression model, we could use the volume to predict the age of a patient. Neural Network, SVMs, Linear Regression and xgboost methods were used for this second task.

Another part of this project was to directly use a Unet architecture with residuals to predict the age of the patient.
