# Deep Learning
1- Recreated a framework for Convolutional Neural Network using Pytroch's simple functions (excluding the use of conv2d function ...). Tested the framework against simple examples and datasets.

2- Coded Variational Auto Encoders (VAE) using Pytorch. Used this architectures on MNIST dataset and displayed the resulting latent space using t-SNE algorithm. Coded a Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Pytorch on CIFAR10 algorithm.

3- Coded a framework for vanilla Recurrent Neural Network, Long short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit and Gated Recurrent Unit. Compared them on a simple audio recognition task.
