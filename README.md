This is the github presenting all the project I have done. Each subfolder have a README, describing what was the purpose of the project and the important files.

## List of subdirectories

### Projects in IMT Atlantique -former Télécom Bretagne- (Brest, France)

**Datamining PUBG**
This folder contains my datamining project related to the Kaggle Challenge on PUBG. PUBG is a game where 100 people drop on a map. The goal of the game is to be the only survivor by killing everyone else. The purpose of the project is to predict the rank of each player during a game based on their statistics. (Python/Scikit-Learn)

**DevOps**
Contains the application that was deployed on OpenStack using docker. Contains also some scripts (Ansible and heat templates), that helped the deployment. (Some parts are in French) **(Docker / OpenStack)**

**NetworkApplication**
Chat Application with the possibility to watch movies in the chatroom. The only part I developped was the networking part. I did not make the GUI. (Python)

**Pixar Project**
This folder contains my part of the source code for the Pixar typed lamp. Especially it contains the protocol allowing a user to transmit moving command to the lamp. The subfolder "TestForTheLamp" contains a test that we made on a lamp. (Arduino / C++)

**Pyrat** 
This projects is revolving around the travelling salesman problem. I had a snake on a randomly generated maze. The snake had to retrieve all the cheese in it. And I had a pre-processing of 3 second. Each file in this folder is an algorithm that I made to solve this problem the fatest way possible. (Python)

**Statistics**
This project was about making a survey on film culture and analyse this survey with inferential statistics. You will find in this folders, the results of the survey, the source code and a report about the project. (Project in French)


### Projects in KAIST  (Daejeon, South Korea)

**Mobile Computing**
 Contains 4 different project  :
- WeatherApp : A "simple" weather application. Objectives of this project : learn about Threads/AsyncTask. Connect to a distant base. Use activities and widgets. (Android Studio / Java)
- Arduino Assignement : Implement a light-based protocol. According to the blinks of a LED light, the receiver (which is also on the Arduino) will decrypt the message. (Arduino / C++)
- HighFreqCommunication : Involves an Android Application and Arduino. The Arduino is sending (according to a protocol based on 3 frequencies 19KHz, 20KHz, 21KHz) a message that the Android Application has to decode. (Arduino/C++, Android Studio/Java)
- SpeakerAndStrobe : This Folder include two applications. In the subfolder "LightPart" you will find an application that turns the phone flashlight into a strobelight that reacts to the music. This means that the light will blink according to the ryhtm of the music. In the subfolder "Whole Application Source Code" you will find the application that connects two smartphones and turn them into (almost) synchronized speakers, with the flashlight acting as a strobelight. (Android Studio/ Java)

**Software Engineering**
This folder contains the TimeTable applicaiton I made for this course. I was the only developper on the team. You will find also the SRS and SDD of the project. (Android / Java)

**System Programming Labs**
Contains the 7 Labs made during my semester in Korea. Each of them is described in the subfolder. (C / Assembly)
