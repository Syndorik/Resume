# Lab3
In this lab I had to "hack" a program having the object file. This was about using the bufferoverflow attack multiple times, and trying to work around some security measures available with GCC.

I worked by dumping the Assembly code of the  **ctarget** object file and **rtarger** object file (/Lab3/target51/ctarget) (/Lab3/target51/rtarget). Then by looking at the assembly code, I found the different solutions. 

Project done in KAIST (Daejeon, South Korea)
