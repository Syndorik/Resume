# System Programing Labs
This folder contains the different lab I did for my System Programing class. The labs were individual. The main purpose of those labs are to know the keys of System Programing. The first part was about Assembly language, and getting used to bitwise operations. The second part was on memory (cache organisation, RAM organisation). And finally the last part was on the System itself (Signals, Process, Threads).


Project done in KAIST (Daejeon, South Korea)

## Files & Folders

**Lab1**
Implementation of different function with some limitation. Most function had to be coded with bitwise operators. (C)

**Lab2**
Defusing a binary bomb by reading Assembly code of the object file. (Assembly / GDB)

**Lab3**
Attacking a program with the bufferoverflow attack. I had first to do a simple buffer overflow attack. Then it was more working around the protection that exist to protect from such attacks.  (Assembly / GDB)

**Lab4**
The first part of the lab was about writing a cache simulator. The second part was about coding a cache-friendly version of the matrix transpose function. (C/GDB)

**Lab5**
This lab was moslty dealing with signals and process. I had to create almost from scratch a very light version of a linux shell. (C/GDB)

**Lab6**
In this lab I had to write from scratch the functions malloc, realloc and free. I used segregated free list to achieve that. (C/GDB)

**Lab7**
In this lab I had to write (almost) from scratch a server proxy. The main purpose of this lab was to work with Threads and Semaphores.
