# Lab2
In this lab I had defuse the different stages of a binaray bomb. I defused all the phases, even the secret phase.

I worked by dumping the Assembly code of the  **bomb** object file (/Lab2/bomb). Then by puting breakpoints around the function that triggered the bomb, I found the solution of the different phases.

Project done in KAIST (Daejeon, South Korea)
