# Datamining PUBG
Built and implemented a model to predict the final placement of a game: PUBG. PUBG is a game were 100 of people drop on a map. They have to kill each other until one remains. The dataset is a selection of over 65000+ games. For each game, we have each player's statistics and based on that, we had to predict the final rank.
Final model: LightGBM
