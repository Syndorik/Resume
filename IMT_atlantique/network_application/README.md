# NetworkApplication
The purpose of this project was to code the applicative layer (from the osi model) in a basic chat application/ movie chat. I did not code the GUI. However I decided what protocol to use and implemented it in UDP and TCP. This application is made with twisted (python's module)

Project done in IMT Atlantique (Former Télécom Bretagne)
