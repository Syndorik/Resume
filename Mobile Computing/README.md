# Mobile Computing
Mobile computing is a class I have taken in Korea. This folder contains the 4 different projects I realised for this class. You will find a more specific precision inside each subfolder

## Folders
**Project 1 -- WeatherApp** 
A "simple" weather application. Objectives of this project : learn about Threads/AsyncTask. Connect to a distant base. Use activities and widgets. (Android Studio / Java)


**Project 2 -- Arduino Assignement** 
Implementation of a light-based protocol. According to the blinks of a LED light, the receiver (which is also on the Arduino) will decrypt the message. (Arduino / C++)

**Project 3 -- HighFreqCommunication**
It Involves an Android Application and Arduino. The Arduino is sending (according to a protocol based on 3 frequencies 19KHz, 20KHz, 21KHz) a message that the Android Application has to decode. (Arduino/C++, Android Studio/Java)


**Project of the semester -- SpeakerAndStrobe**
This Folder include two applications. In the subfolder "LightPart" you will find an application that turns the phone flashlight into a strobelight that reacts to the music. This means that the light will blink according to the ryhtm of the music. In the subfolder "Whole Application Source Code" you will find the application that connects two smartphones and turn them into (almost) synchronized speakers, with the flashlight acting as a strobelight. (Android Studio/ Java)
