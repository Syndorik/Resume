# Project of the semester -- SpeakerAndStrobe
This Folder include two applications. In the subfolder "LightPart" you will find an application that turns the phone flashlight into a strobelight that reacts to the music. This means that the light will blink according to the ryhtm of the music. In the subfolder "Whole Application Source Code" you will find the application that connects two smartphones and turn them into (almost) synchronized speakers, with the flashlight acting as a strobelight. (Android Studio/ Java).
I made the Light part in this project, and helped on the Bluetooth connection.
